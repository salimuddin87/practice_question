1. SOAP -> XML-based for enterprise application
Example:- Used in financial services and payment gateways
where security and reliability are key.

2. REST-ful -> Resource-based (JSON) for web servers
Easy to implement, and use HTTP methods. Good for real-time
data or operate with a highly connected data model.
Example:- Used by Twitter and YouTube

3. GraphQL -> Query language reduce network load
Allows clients to ask for specific data as they need. This means no more
over-fetching or under-fetching of data. This leads to more efficient network
communication and faster responses. It also requires more processing on the
server side due to its flexible querying capabilities.
Example:- Facebook, GitHub, Shopify

4. gRPC -> High performance for microservices
It's modern, high-performance, and uses Protocol Buffers. Netflix use gRPC to
handle their immense iter-service communication. However, if you are dealing with
browser clients, gRPC might pose some challenges due to limited browser support.
Example:- Netflix

5. WebSocket -> Bi-directional for low-latency data exchange
It is all about real-time, bidirectional, and persistent connections.
It's perfect for live chat applications and real-time gaming, where
low-latency data exchange is crucial.
Example:-

6. Webhook -> Asynchronous for event-driven application
It's all about event-driven, HTTP callbacks, and asynchronous operation.
For instance, GitHub uses webhooks to notify your other systems whenever
a new commit is pushed. But, if you need synchronous communication or
immediate response, webhook might not be best bet.
Example:- GitHub
